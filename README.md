 ## Overview

 
This is a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge. 

The Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.


## Challenges 

The hardest part of the challenge was making the design look exactly like the one that was provided. I believe I replicated it well enough, but I could've been better. I also have not used regular HTML markup in a while, so it was a little challenging as opposed to using React.

I initially decided to use tailwind CSS at the beginning, but decided aganist it halfway through.
