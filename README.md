# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component

This is a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge. 

The Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.



## The challenge

The challenge is to build out a card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.



The hardest part of the challenge was making the design look exactly like the one that was provided. I believe I replicated it well enough, but I could've been better. 

I initially decided to use tailwind CSS at the beginning, but decided aganist it halfway through.


You can see the results live on Vercel: 
**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
